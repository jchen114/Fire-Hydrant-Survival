# Fire-Hydrant-Survival
You are a fire hydrant. The last fire hydrant in the city that has not been rusted away by legions of dogs. The only way you can fend off your doom is by squirting them away. You have a fixed water supply that regenerates slowly but watch out! If you use too much, you will have to wait for a while to start regenerating water. Use it wisely and aim well. Fortunately, power ups exist along the way. You can restore your health, squirt with greater frequency, increase tank size, and squirt with greater velocity. 

Good Luck!
